Introduction
>Malware scene is everchanging
>We detect malware usnig static and dynamic analysis
>Easy to fool static analysis and dynamic analysis hard, so use extracted api call from sandbox to categorize 
Brief overview of setup
>2 part:The data extraction part and the embedding, then ml/dl part
Extract behaviour(which files/directories it made, what api calls in general) in json file, feed it into api2vec pipeline to generate embedding, then use that to train model
Brief discussion of Kaggle dataset
>As of right now, we are using a kaggle dataset to train our model as we are still building our dataset.Our strategy for choosing malware samples is if they have been around since 1 year
>Discussion of dataset features
Brief overview of Embedding pipeline and it's results
>sohil bhai pls dekhle
Brief overview of nn, discussion of their architecture and results
>NNs used 
>Brief description of nns used
>description of fnn, rnn, lstm
>results
